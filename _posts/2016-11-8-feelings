Hey anyone that might see this...

My site is still under development because sadly I am a recovering perfectionist and procrastinator *dies*

But Im from 'MERIKA! And the 2016 Election is really affecting me and I would prefer to speak about it here, in a equally underdeveloped system (teehee!).

I am 21 now, and when I first had the chance to vote between Mitt and Obama I didn't vote due to chronic laziness and  I felt really really guilty about it. All I could think about was how my country would be affected, how other countries would be affected, and if my vote really even mattered in the ocean of american power...

But this year, 2016, everyone seems to me as disatisfied as I am! I disagree with both Hillary and Trump. And if I disagree, I disagree completely and equally!

If I were to vote, which I really want to, I would vote for Jill Stein. And that's only because I mostly agree with her and I guess there isnt a perfect candidate. 
Sadly, all I hear is if I vote for a third party candi, is im basically voting for trump. And if I dont vote, im voting for trump. WHAT? Is that supposed to be like scary boogyman tactic to get me to vote Hillary??

If I REALLY HAD to vote for a major party candi, Id prob be an ass and vote Trump! TBH!! I dont even like him as person and I fully agree that he could be considered a monster but, Bro to me,
Hillary stands for 100% everything I hate! I cant! EVEN! SO dont try to scare and guilt trip me inot feeding into your fake "good" solution, cuz the horrible rebellion in me will choose the one with clear horns on his head.

He uses fear directly but she uses it passive agressively! 

Just please let me do me and love me anyway. And Im sorry to all if my or anyones chose goes awry...

We all mean the best!

One Love For All!! <3 :*
